# NEA
This is my A-Level Computer Science NEA which is a store management system for an imaginary store owner. The system users are either a customers or admins, where the customer can browse for items and 'purchase' them, which emails them a receipt of the items they bought, or they can be an admin, where you can view the logistics of item sales, and add new items to sell etc. All passwords are hashed using a salt.

To log in as an admin, you will need to go into the database and either delete all the users or replace one of the admin emails with your own and get a password change to that email.
